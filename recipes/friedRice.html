    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Fried rice is a versatile and flavorful dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with a mix of ingredients such as vegetables, eggs, and protein (like chicken, shrimp, or pork). Common seasonings include soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and green onions. Originating in China, fried rice has countless regional and international variations, making it a popular way to repurpose leftover rice into a quick and satisfying meal. It's typically cooked in a hot wok or skillet to achieve a slightly crispy texture and rich, savory taste.</p>

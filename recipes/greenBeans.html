    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese-style green beans are a popular stir-fry dish featuring crisp-tender green beans cooked at high heat, often blistered or charred slightly for added flavor. They’re typically tossed with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sometimes dried chilies or ground pork for extra depth. The dish balances savory, salty, and slightly sweet flavors, and is known for its vibrant color and bold taste. It’s commonly served as a side dish in Chinese cuisine, especially in Sichuan-style cooking, where a bit of heat adds a distinctive kick.</p>
